## Getting Started

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

To make things work on your local simulator, or on your phone, you need first to [run `eas build`](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite/blob/master/docs/expo/EAS.md). We have many shortcuts on `package.json` to make it easier:

```bash
yarn build:ios:sim # build for ios simulator
yarn build:ios:dev # build for ios device
yarn build:ios:prod # build for ios device
```

### `./assets` directory

This directory is designed to organize and store various assets, making it easy for you to manage and use them in your application. The assets are further categorized into subdirectories, including `icons` and `images`:

```tree
assets
├── icons
└── images
```

**icons**
This is where your icon assets will live. These icons can be used for buttons, navigation elements, or any other UI components. The recommended format for icons is PNG, but other formats can be used as well.

Ignite comes with a built-in `Icon` component. You can find detailed usage instructions in the [docs](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite/blob/master/docs/boilerplate/app/components/Icon.md).

**images**
This is where your images will live, such as background images, logos, or any other graphics. You can use various formats such as PNG, JPEG, or GIF for your images.

Another valuable built-in component within Ignite is the `AutoImage` component. You can find detailed usage instructions in the [docs](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite/blob/master/docs/Components-AutoImage.md).

How to use your `icon` or `image` assets:

```typescript
import { Image } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Image source={require('../assets/images/my_image.png')} />
  );
};
```
